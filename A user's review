Just tried LibreCad and must say it was completely disappointing.
Very user unfriendly, no help and the worse thing is it crashes once I try to save anything.
I know what the problem is, it's Qt (which stands for Quite Terrible) and completely useless.
Even Nokia gave up on it.
So until Qt is taken out of the equation, I will stick with A9CAD and CadStdLite.
The people that have created Librecad have wasted a lot of time using Qt.
